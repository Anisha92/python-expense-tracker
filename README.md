# python-expense-tracker
A beautifully designed Expense Tracker App built using Python Tkinter. It helps users manage daily spending with features like add, edit, delete, filter, and total calculation. Data is saved in a CSV file, and the UI is designed with soft colors for a clean and modern experience. Great showcase of Python GUI + file handling skills!
